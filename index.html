    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>

      And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

      To flutter - and the Bird is on the Wing.
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>"Hope"</em> is the thing with feathers<br>
That perches in the soul<br>
And sings the tune without the words<br>
And never stops at all<br>
