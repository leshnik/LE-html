  William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen
  lines long (three
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
  followed by a rhyming
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
  <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
  </p>
</blockquote>

   Edward Fitzgerald demonstrates what a <em>ruba'i</em> is in this example from the <em>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</em>:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>
     Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br>
     Your Winter garment of Repentance fling:<br>
       The Bird of Time has but a little way<br>
     To flutter - and the Bird is on the Wing.
   </p>
 </blockquote>
